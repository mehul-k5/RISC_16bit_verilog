# Design, implementation and testing of 16 bit Multi-cycle RISC processor using verilog

*The design consists of several sub-modules such as: Instruction and data memory, Register file, Arithmetic logic unit, and Control unit<br/>
*The instruction set contains 18 instructions which included different versions of Add, Subtract, Shift, NAND, OR, Jump, Branch, Load, and Store
*Verilog system tasks were used for loading instructions given by the user in hexadecimal format and outputting results on a terminal
*Intensive testing was performed for all the sub-modules by using various test cases that included boundary cases.
*The final processor testing was performed using programs that consisted of multiple arithmetic, logical instructions, constructs such as loops, conditional statements, load, and store.
